# Cat's Claw (Uncaria tomentosa): Risks and Contraindications

## Important Safety Information
While Cat's Claw is generally considered safe for most adults when used appropriately, there are important risks and contraindications to consider.

## Known Risks and Side Effects

### Pregnancy and Lactation
- **Pregnancy**: Cat's Claw should be avoided during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests it may stimulate uterine contractions, potentially leading to miscarriage. Pregnant individuals should not use Cat's Claw unless under the supervision of a qualified healthcare provider.
- **Breastfeeding**: There is insufficient data on the safety of Cat's Claw during breastfeeding. It is best to avoid use unless a healthcare professional advises otherwise.

### Autoimmune Diseases
Because Cat's Claw can stimulate the immune system, it may exacerbate autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. Individuals with autoimmune disorders should consult a physician before using Cat's Claw.

### Bleeding Disorders and Surgery
Cat's Claw may slow blood clotting. There is a theoretical risk of increased bleeding, especially when combined with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel). Discontinue use at least two weeks before scheduled surgery.

### Kidney Disorders
Some sources indicate that Cat's Claw could potentially affect kidney function. Individuals with kidney disease or those taking medications that affect the kidneys should use caution and seek medical advice.

### Allergic Reactions
Though rare, allergic reactions to Cat's Claw are possible. Symptoms may include skin rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing. Discontinue use if any allergic symptoms occur.

### Drug Interactions
- **Immunosuppressants**: Cat's Claw may interfere with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus) used after organ transplants or for autoimmune conditions.
- **Blood Pressure Medications**: Cat's Claw may lower blood pressure; combining it with antihypertensive drugs could lead to hypotension.
- **Diabetes Medications**: It may affect blood sugar levels, potentially altering the effectiveness of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.

### Gastrointestinal Distress
High doses or prolonged use may cause stomach upset, diarrhea, or nausea in some individuals.

## Special Populations
- **Children**: Safety and appropriate dosing for children have not been established. Avoid use unless guided by a pediatric healthcare provider.
- **Elderly**: Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of Cat's Claw, especially regarding blood pressure and kidney function.

## Quality and Source Considerations
- Ensure the product is labeled as **Uncaria tomentosa**. Other species (e.g., *Uncaria guianensis*) may have different safety profiles.
- Purchase from reputable suppliers to avoid contamination or adulteration.

## General Precautions
1. Start with a low dose to assess tolerance.
2. Do not exceed recommended dosages unless under professional guidance.
3. Monitor for any adverse effects, especially when combining with other supplements or medications.
4. Keep healthcare providers informed of all herbal supplements you are taking.
