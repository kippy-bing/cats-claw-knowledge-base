# Cat's Claw (Uncaria tomentosa) Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized, reliable, and evolving source of information for natural health enthusiasts and herbalists interested in Cat's Claw, a Peruvian mountain rain forest herb. The goal is to move beyond "word of mouth" and establish a citable, community-reviewed resource that documents the benefits, uses, risks, and scientific evidence for *Uncaria tomentosa*.

## Importance of Correct Plant Source
It is crucial to distinguish between different species of Cat's Claw. The primary medicinal species is **Uncaria tomentosa** (often called "uña de gato" in Spanish). Another species, *Uncaria guianensis*, is also used but has different phytochemical profiles. For consistency and safety, this knowledge base focuses on *Uncaria tomentosa* unless otherwise noted. Always verify the botanical source when purchasing or preparing Cat's Claw products.
